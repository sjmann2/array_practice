### Self-Evaluation
- **How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?**
  - I feel fairly confident in what I've learned so far, it's been helpful to try out methods on my own and see if I can figure out what they will do before looking up an explanation. Talking about code in the correct way and remembering the terminology is taking some getting used to.
- **Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?**
  - I am curious about the various methods that exist in ruby and will spend some time scrolling through the Array document just to familiarize myself with them.
- **What questions do you have about Arrays?**
  - Creating an array with booleans confused me the most, I don't understand how a list of [true, false, true] actually works in practice. It feels like something I would have to see in real code to fully understand.
